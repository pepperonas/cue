### Added
- **Run engine** — execute saved prompts through the Claude Code CLI via a
  Mac-side runner (`cue-runner/`) that polls cue, atomically claims runs, runs
  them headless (`claude -p --output-format stream-json`), and reports results.
  - **single** (one prompt) and **chain**/playbook (ordered prompts in one Claude
    session via `--session-id`/`--resume`) runs.
  - Owner-only **Runs** tab with status badges, live log tail, copyable session
    id, cost, step breakdown, **cancel** and **re-run**.
  - `RunDialog` with whitelisted project path, model, permission-mode, allowed
    tools, bare mode, skip-permissions (warned), stop-on-error.
  - Project-path whitelist (server + runner), `RUNNER_TOKEN` auth, atomic claim,
    heartbeat, and a stale-run reaper.
